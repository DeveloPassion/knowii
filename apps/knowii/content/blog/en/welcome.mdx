This is a demo blog post to show how the blog works. In this post I will be talking about how to use the blog and what you can do with it.

## Mdx

This blog is built using [mdx](https://mdxjs.com/). Mdx is a markdown extension that allows you to write markdown and then add react components to it. This means you can write markdown and then add components to it. This is great for adding things like images and videos to your blog posts as well as interactive components.

## Images

The blog also uses [next/image](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image) to handle images. This means you can add images to your blog posts and they will be lazy loaded and optimized for the web.

## Formatting

supastarter also includes formatting for all common markdown elements. You can write **bold**, _italic_, and ~~strikethrough~~ text. You can also write code inline like `const x = 1` or in a block:

```typescript
// my awesome code snippet
if (true) {
  console.log('hello world');
}
```

Of course you can also use lists:

- list item 1
- list item 2
- list item 3

If you want to add a horizontal rule you can do that too:

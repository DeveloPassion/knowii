# TODO

- Add tests for keyword extraction
- Add reset button to createResourceDialog form
- If error while saving resource, CreateResourceDialog should stop the loading spinner
  - should be handled in knowii-api-client.ts
  - Fix knowii-api-client: should not try to parse directly, or at least should not EXPLODE if the response does not have the hoped structure
- CreateTextResource
  - Delay page loading. First only use the provided data, and trigger batch job doing the rest
- Reject urls pointing to files (audio, video, etc)
- Add tests for ProcessHtml
- Add Browserless in production
  - Try to use /active (Returns a simple "204" HTTP code, with no response, indicating that the service itself is up and running. Useful for liveliness probes or other external checks): https://docs.browserless.io/open-api#:~:text=/active,other%20external%20checks.
- TODO show both the community specific name/description and the resource generic one
